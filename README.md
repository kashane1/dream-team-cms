## Process
It was an interesting assignment because working with a database has proven difficult if I can't see the interface. I have to imagine the changes as I'm writting them. I know with more practice I will get more comfortable with the mysql language. I was constantly refering to documentation on how to write mysql. I struggled so much with querying a name of a role to get the id of that role and then to query again with that gather id. I found a work around, but I wish I had figured out that line of code. I also attempted the bonus of gathering the combined salaries, but eventually gave up because I realized I didn't have enough time. After all is said and done, I know I learned a lot from this homework assignment becuase I had to put so many hours into it.
